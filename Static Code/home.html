                <h2>Problem Statement:</h2>
                <p> We realized that there were not a lot of resources to help the mental health of first-generation college students, so we took inspiration from places like alcoholics anonymous but made it online and specifically tailored towards first-generation college students. 
                    The site has two main functionalities, the forum, and the journaling system. The forum has a feature to create and sign into accounts and start discussions that other users can view. The journal provides daily prompts focused on problems that first-generation college students face, and it only saves data locally, providing the user with a sense of privacy. 
                    The front end was built using HTML and CSS to make the website, and Javascript was used to build the forum and journal system.
                    The back end, which is the accounts system was built using node.js.
